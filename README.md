nuvola (with the lowercase n) is a tool to dump and perform automatic and manual security analysis on AWS environments configurations and services using predefined, extensible and custom rules created using a simple Yaml syntax.

The general idea behind this project is to create an abstracted digital twin of a cloud platform. For a more concrete example: nuvola reflects the BloodHound traits used for Active Directory analysis but on cloud environments (at the moment only AWS).

The usage of a graph database also increases the possibility of finding different and innovative attack paths and can be used as an offline, centralised and lightweight digital twin.

## Quick Start

### Requirements

- `docker-compose` installed
- an AWS account configured to be used with `awscli` with full access to the cloud resources, better if in _ReadOnly_ mode (the policy `arn:aws:iam::aws:policy/ReadOnlyAccess` is fine)

### Setup

1. Clone the repository

```bash
git clone --depth=1 https://github.com/primait/nuvola.git; cd nuvola
```

2. Create and **edit**, if required, the `.env` file to set your DB username/password/URL

```bash
cp .env_example .env;
```

You may need to edit the size of the memory allocated to Neo4j in you run the tool in a low-RAM device.

3. Start the Neo4j docker instance

```bash
make start
```

4. Build the tool

```bash
make build
```

### Usage

1. Firstly you need to dump all the supported AWS services configurations and load the data into the Neo4j database:

```bash
./nuvola dump -profile default_RO -outputdir ~/DumpDumpFolder -format zip
```

2. To import a previously executed dump operation into the Neo4j database:

```bash
./nuvola assess -import ~/DumpDumpFolder/nuvola-default_RO_20220901.zip
```

3. To only perform static assessments on the data loaded into the Neo4j database using the [predefined ruleset](https://github.com/primait/nuvola/tree/master/assess/rules):

```bash
./nuvola assess
```

4. Or use [Neo4j Browser](https://neo4j.com/docs/operations-manual/current/installation/neo4j-browser/) to manually explore the digital twin.
